== Synopsis

This is a Ruby library to support parsing
Taverna[http://taverna.sourceforge.net] version 2 workflows (T2Flows). This
relies on the functionality provided by the libxml-ruby library.  To be able
to utilise this gem to its full potential, you will need to have the following
installed on your system.
- GraphViz[http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php] (a graph visualization package)

== The T2Flow Model Implementation

Much like the Taverna[http://taverna.sourceforge.net] 1 Scufl model, T2Flows
contain Processors, Sinks, and Sources. T2Flows however, encapsulate these
elements within Dataflow objects. A Dataflow objects is the container for all
the different elements present within the
Taverna[http://taverna.sourceforge.net] 2 workflows, hence a single T2Flow may
have one or more dataflows. WorkflowDescriptions and Links, from the original
Taverna[http://taverna.sourceforge.net] 1 workflows (Scufl), have been renamed
in T2Flows to DataflowAnnotations and Datalinks respectively.
DataflowAnnotations, however, allow for multiple titles, authors, and
descriptions, as opposed to the single value attributes held for Scufls.

== Installation
To install the Taverna 2 gem taverna-t2flow[https://rubygems.org/gems/taverna-t2flow], type into your command prompt:
  [sudo] gem install taverna-t2flow

== Usage

To be able to use this gem, you need to require the library:
  require 'taverna-t2flow'

=== t2flow models
  
To generate the model you can then use the gem as follows:
  foo = File.new("path/to/workflow/file", "r")
  bar = T2Flow::Parser.new.parse(foo)

Alternatively:
  foo = File.new("path/to/workflow/file", "r").read
  bar = T2Flow::Parser.new.parse(foo)

You will then be able to use your T2Flow model to retrieve information about
the workflow by invoking the different methods and attributes.
  bar.INVOKED
... where INVOKED is the method or attribute required.

You can also interact with remote workflows.
  require "open-uri"
  
  foo = Uri.parse("xxxx://uri_to_workflow").read
  bar = T2Flow::Parser.new.parse(foo)

=== t2flow diagrams

To be able to use any diagram functionality included in thsi gem you need to
have GraphViz[http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php] installed on your system.
Once this package has been installed, you may use the gem to draw an image
showing the structure of the T2Flow as follows.
  out_file = File.new("path/to/file/you/want/the/dot/script/to/be/written", "w+")
  T2Flow::Dot.new.write_dot(out_file, bar)
  `dot -Tpng -o"path/to/the/output/image" #{out_file.path}`
  
The last line draws a PNG image using +out_file+.  To learn more about dot,
try typing into your command prompt:
  % man dot
or
  % dot -h
